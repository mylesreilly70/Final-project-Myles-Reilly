This is the Final Project of our Fall CMPINF 0010 course.
# The Best Neighborhood Project
In this project our goal is to create and use metrics in order to judge all 90 neighborhoods in Pittsburgh in order to find out which neighborhood is the best. We have each been tasked with finding a dataset on the WPRDC website. This website offers a myriad of datasets created by government agenes all related to diffrent subjects and aspects of the area. 
#Goal
My initial goal was to find a dataset and create a metric from this dataset to be used to judge the neighborhoods. I decided on the metric of speeding, specifically how many speeders each town had recorded. An essential part of a safe neighborhood is its roads, if a neighborhood has unsafe roads then it will not be a good place to live.
